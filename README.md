# mc-image

Compile Minecraft to a native executable using [GraalVM native-image](https://www.graalvm.org/native-image/)!

⚠️ Only Linux is currently supported!

## Build instructions

1. Build the Gradle project using `./gradlew assemble`
2. Run `./build.sh`

After a few minutes, a `minecraft-client` executable will have been produced.
You can run it using `run.sh`, which passes a few arguments Minecraft requires.

If you pass `--server` to `build.sh`, you will instead get a `minecraft-server` binary containing the server, and which you run directly instead of using `run.sh`.

### Binary distribution

Since executables as generated by build.sh are essentially full distributions of the Minecraft codebase, the Minecraft EULA does not permit distributing them without explicit permission by Mojang.
